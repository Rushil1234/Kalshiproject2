# Kalshi Trading Bot - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Market Data API Endpoint Issue
**Problem**: The trading bot was using an incorrect API endpoint to fetch market data, resulting in 404 errors.
**Solution**: Updated the endpoint in `src/trading/trader.py` from `/v2/markets/{ticker}` to `/trade-api/v2/markets/{ticker}`.

### 2. NOAA API Timeout Issues
**Problem**: The NOAA data downloader was experiencing timeouts when fetching weather data, causing the trading loop to stall.
**Solution**: 
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Reduced timeout from 30 seconds to 15 seconds
- Added proper error handling for timeout exceptions
- Added missing `time` module import

### 3. Market Scanner Performance
**Problem**: The market scanner was fetching all markets without filtering, causing slow performance.
**Solution**:
- Added category filtering to only fetch weather markets
- Limited the number of iterations to prevent excessive fetching
- Added detailed logging for debugging

## Key Code Changes

### `src/trading/trader.py`
- Fixed market data API endpoint
- Removed duplicate/simulated code at the end of the trading loop
- Updated `TradeExecutor.place_trade` to call the real Kalshi API `place_order` method
- Increased max_iterations limit for trading loop

### `src/data_collection/kalshi_scanner.py`
- Added category filtering to only fetch weather markets
- Limited iterations to prevent excessive fetching
- Added detailed logging for debugging market fetching

### `src/data_collection/noaa_downloader.py`
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for NOAA API calls
- Reduced timeout from 30 seconds to 15 seconds
- Added proper error handling for timeout exceptions
- Added missing `time` module import
- Added debug logging to track data fetching progress

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- Market data fetch now works correctly
- NOAA data downloader successfully fetches weather data for valid date ranges
- Market scanner finds Philadelphia weather markets efficiently
- Trading loop executes without stalling

## Next Steps

1. Run the full trading bot to verify actual trade placement
2. Monitor for any additional issues during live trading
3. Consider adding more sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Add more detailed logging for trade execution
5. Consider implementing a dry-run mode for testing without actual trades

The bot should now be able to:
- Scan for Philadelphia weather markets efficiently
- Fetch market data correctly
- Download NOAA weather data without timeouts
- Place actual trades through the Kalshi API
- Run the trading loop without stalling
